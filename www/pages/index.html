<h1>Welcome to Brut</h1>
<p>Brut is a brutalist static site generator.</p>
<p>It shares some of the principles behind brutalist architecture:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Raw</strong>: embrace raw materialsâ€”concrete for buildings, html and
    js for the web
  </li>
  <li><strong>Functional</strong>: don't do any more than necessary</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dependable</strong>: focus on stability, move slow and don't break
    things
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is designed to help build static websites out of a collection of raw js (or
  ts), html, and markdown files (plus static assets). Nothing more, nothing
  less.
